<h2 class="hh">The History of Cars: From Steam to Speed</h2> 
<p class="first">
    <img src="C:\Users\Varadarajan\OneDrive\Pictures\df.avif" >
    The story of the automobile began in the late 1800s, when inventors first combined engines and wheels to create self-propelled vehicles.
One of the most famous pioneers was Karl Benz, who introduced the Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1886.
It had three wheels and a tiny gasoline-powered engine, but it laid the foundation for what would become one of the world’s most transformative inventions.
Over the next century, the automobile would reshape society, industry, and the very layout of cities.

</p>
<h2 class="ac">The Rise of the Automobile Industry</h2>
<p class="second">
    <img src="C:\Users\Varadarajan\OneDrive\Pictures\men-working-on-model-a-assembly-line-image-820x460-d.jpeg">
    By the early 20th century, mass production revolutionized car manufacturing.
Henry Ford's introduction of the assembly line in 1913 made cars more affordable and accessible to the general public.
What was once a luxury became a necessity for everyday life.
Companies like Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler led the charge in America, while European brands like Mercedes-Benz and Peugeot made major contributions across the Atlantic.
</p>
<h2 class="ad">Evolution into Performance Cars</h2>
<p class="third">
    As technology advanced, so did the desire for speed and performance.
By the mid-20th century, automakers began producing cars that weren’t just about transportation—they &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;were about excitement.
Brands like Ferrari, Jaguar, and Porsche emerged with vehicles that emphasized speed, handling, and style.

<img src="C:\Users\Varadarajan\OneDrive\Pictures\mclaren-750s-driving-720x405px.jpg">
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;These cars were more than machines—they were symbols of status, freedom, and innovation.

</p>
<h2 class="ae">What Are Supercars?</h2>
<p class="fourth">
    <img src="C:\Users\Varadarajan\OneDrive\Pictures\F40_Ferrari_20090509.jpg" >
    Supercars are high-performance sports cars designed for superior speed, acceleration, and aesthetics.
Typically featuring powerful engines—often V8s, V10s, or V12s—these vehicles are precision-built for both the road and the racetrack.
Supercars often boast exotic designs, cutting-edge aerodynamics, and lightweight materials such as carbon fiber.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Famous supercars include the Ferrari F40, Lamborghini Aventador, and McLaren 720S.
</p>
<h2 class="af">The Birth of the Hypercar</h2>
<p class="fifth">
    <img src="C:\Users\Varadarajan\OneDrive\Pictures\jjk.jpg" >
    Hypercars take the concept of supercars to the extreme.
While there's no strict definition, hypercars typically feature groundbreaking technology, top-tier performance specs, and extremely limited production.
They are often more expensive and more exclusive than supercars, showcasing the pinnacle of automotive engineering.
Examples include the Bugatti &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Chiron, Koenigsegg Jesko, and Aston Martin Valkyrie.
</p>
<h2 class="ag">Supercars vs. Hypercars: Whats the Difference?</h2>
<p class="six">
    While both categories represent high-performance vehicles, the distinction lies in their capabilities and exclusivity.
Supercars are fast, luxurious, and built for performance, but hypercars push beyond—often using hybrid or electric drivetrains, active aerodynamics, and Formula 1-level technology.
In short, all hypercars are supercars, but not all supercars qualify as hypercars.
</p>
<h2 class="ah">The Role of Electric and Hybrid technology</h2>
<p class="sev">
    <img src="C:\Users\Varadarajan\OneDrive\Pictures\intro_slider_07_optimised-960x540.jpg" >
In recent years, even supercars and hypercars have embraced electric and hybrid technology.
With growing concerns about emissions and sustainability, brands like Rimac, Lotus, and even Ferrari are building all-electric or hybrid performance vehicles.
The Rimac Nevera, for example, is an all-electric hypercar capable of reaching 60 mph in under two &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;seconds, proving that green tech can be blisteringly fast.
</p>
<h2 class="ai">The Future of Performance Cars</h2>
<p class="eit">
Looking ahead, the line between performance and sustainability continues to blur.
As regulations tighten and technology improves, future supercars and hypercars are expected to be cleaner, smarter, and even faster.
Autonomous driving features, AI-assisted performance systems, and advanced materials like graphene may play a role in shaping the next &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;generation of automotive legends.
